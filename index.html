                  <p>As a new student at <a href="http://www.epicodus.com" target="_blank">Epicodus</a>, I'd like for you to know a bit more about me</p>
                  <p>I'm one of a few of us that bikes in daily and I'm rarely without a coffee.  This week has been challenging; usually in a <em>good</em> way and hopefully this excercise gives me a good idea of my progress and what aspects of the coursework I need to imrove upon.</p>

              <p>Originally from the midwest, I attended school in NYC and fell into a position as a frontend developer for a few agencies during the .com boom.  With the inevitable .com bust and general unlivability of NYC immediately following 9/11, I left NYC and spent the next few years focusing on music as a touring musician and a label owner.  With the advent of streaming and  that industry essentially going belly up, I tried my hand a few different things before following my wife, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mcteenie/">Coco</a>, to Oregon for her to further her career in the nursing field.</p>
              <p>Now that I'm here and we're settled, I have to opportunity to learn how to code properly and shift my means of supporting myself from <strong>job</strong> to <strong>career</strong>.  Despite the fact that I am woefully out of practice, I'm enjoying the program and the challenges of immersing myself into re-learning (hopefully <em>properly</em> this time) the skills necessary to pursue coding and programming as a career.</p>
